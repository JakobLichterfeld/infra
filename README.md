Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

After using a shell script to automate my desktop Ubuntu installation from 2011 to 2023, I finally migrated the 2646 lines of code to Ansible. Thanks to [notthebee](https://github.com/notthebee/) for the final push.

My shell scripts for automating my Raspberry Pi installations will follow.

## Requirements

It assumes a fresh Ubuntu Server 20.04 install, access to a non-root user with sudo privileges and a public SSH key. This can be configured during the installation process.
